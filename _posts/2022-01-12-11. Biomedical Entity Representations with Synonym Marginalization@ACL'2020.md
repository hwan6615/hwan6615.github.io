# Abstract
이 논문은 biomedical named entities의 표현 학습에 초점을 맞춘다. 제공된 동의어의 불완전성과 다양한 표면 형태 때문에 biomedical entity normalization이 매우 어렵다는 문제에 직면해 있다.

이 연구는 biomedical entity의 동의어에만 기반하여 개체 표현을 학습하는 데 중점을 둔다. 불완전한 동의어로부터 학습하기 위해 모델 기반 후보 선택을 사용하며, 상위 후보에 존재하는 동의어의 한계 가능도(marginal likelihood)를 최대화한다. 이 모델 기반 후보들은 모델이 진화함에 따라 더 어려운 부정 샘플을 포함하도록 반복적으로 업데이트된다. 이를 통해 40만 개 이상의 후보 중에서 부정 샘플을 명시적으로 사전 선택하는 것을 피한다.

제안하는 모델인 BIOSYN은 세 가지 다른 개체 유형(질병, 화학 물질, 부작용)을 포함하는 네 가지 생의학 개체 정규화 데이터셋에서 이전 최신 모델들을 지속적으로 능가하며, 각 데이터셋의 성능 상한선에 거의 도달한다.

# Conclusion and Review
* BIOSYN 모델을 제시하면서 synonym marginalization 기법과 iterative candidate retrieval을 통하여 biomedical entity representations를 학습함
* Biomedical entity normalization의 4개의 datasets에서 SOTA performance를 보임(up to 2.6%)
* 추후에 다른 언어에 적용하거나, downstream tasks에서 entity normalization의 quality를 증명하려고 함
* IR 방식으로 문제를 접근했다는 점이 흥미로웠음
* Negative candidates의 수가 많은 문제가 과연 critical한 문제일까 라는 생각
